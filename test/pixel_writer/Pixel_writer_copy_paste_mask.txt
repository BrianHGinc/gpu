Pixel Writer with copy, paste, paste_mask & set_RGB legend:

A = Reset both collision counters.

B = Copy pixel @0x0ABC-2, 16 color = '0xB'

C = Paste_mask 16 color pixel '0xB' to 0x0111-1.
    Since pixel @0x0111-1 wasn't 0x0 to begin with, collision_rd +1.
    Since color '0xB' was written into 0x0111-1 which wasn't 0, collision_wr +1.

D = Copy pixel @0x0ABC-3, 16 color = '0x0'.

E = Paste_mask 16 color pixel '0x0' to 0x0111-1.
    Since pixel @0x0111-1 wasn't 0x0 to begin with, collision_rd +1 again.
    Since color '0x0' is transparent, 0x0111-1 kept the earlier '0xB'color
    and collision_wr stayed the same.

F = Normal paste 16 color pixel '0x0' to 0x0111-1.
    Since pixel @0x0111-1 wasn't 0x0 to begin with, collision_rd +1 again.
    Normal paste means the color '0x0' was written into 0x0111-1 and since
    the pixel was originally '0xB', the collision_wr +1.

G = Paste_mask 16 color pixel '0x0' to 0x0111-1.
    Since pixel @0x0111-1 is 0x0 to begin with, the collision_rd stayed the same.
    Since color '0x0' is transparent, 0x0111-1 kept the earlier '0x0'color
    and collision_wr stayed the same.

H = set_rgb = This passes the first 16 bits in the command bus directly into
    the copy pixel buffer so you may write 16 bit true color RGB pixels
    using the pixel_paste command afterwards.
