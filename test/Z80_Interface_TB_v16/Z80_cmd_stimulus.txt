******************************************************************************************************************

For a command to be accepted, it must have the 'at' symbol (SHIFT 2) in front of it.
Example:

[at]COMMAND_STRING <arg> <arg> <arg> ...

***Removing the [at] symbol means the command is ignored and it is treated as text comments.
Multiple commands are allowed on one line so long as each command has an [at] symbol in front of it.

******************************************************************************************************************
Commands: (*** No spaces allowed in any <FILE_NAME>)

[at]LOG_FILE  <FILE_NAME>            > Generates a results log file.         (No spaces allowed in file name).
[at]END_LOG_FILE                     > Forcefully closes/ends the log file.
[at]STOP                             > Stops the script processing/simulation.  Click on 'run -all' to continue script after the stop command.
[at]END                              > Ends the script processing/simulation. (You may now paint/set your own manual controls in the waveform view and run -all)

[at]RESET                            > Hard Resets the system
