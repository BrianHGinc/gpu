Ellipse draw function table.
For a draw comand to be accepted, it must have an 'at' symbol in front of it.

Filled   = 0,1           - Tells the ellipse generator if it should do a raster fill.
Quadrant = 0,1,2,3       - Tells the ellipse generator which 1 of the 4 quadrants to draw.
Xc       = [-2048..2047] - Specifies the X center coordinate of the ellipse.
Yc       = [-2048..2047] - Specifies the Y center coordinate of the ellipse.
Xr       = [0..1023]     - Specifies the X radius of the ellipse.
Yr       = [0..1023]     - Specifies the Y radius of the ellipse.
Color    = [0..255]      - Draw color in generated bitmap, 0=black, 255=100% white.

Full command:
[at]Filled,Quadrant,Xc,Yc,Xr,Yr,color

***Warning, there are no checks, there needs to be 6 numbers after the [at] symbol.
***Removing the [at] symbol means the command is ignored and trreated as text comments.
