# Microcom GPU

## GPU

This is the primary project folder and is compatible with Quartus Prime and Quartus II (potentially).

In here you will find source code (in Verilog) for the GPU project and its various modules.  You should be able to load the project into Quartus II/Prime without any major difficulties.
