# Microcom GPU

The aim of this project is to create, from scratch, a GPU or 'graphics card' for my home-made Microcom computer (details of which will be available on a website sometime in the future!)  This repo is a storage site for the HDL code used to describe the GPU itself.

When the project is completed, the GPU will support text (via a VT100 compatible console) and graphics modes.  The project is currently in development - see [eevBlog](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/fpga/fpga-vga-controller-for-8-bit-computer/new/#new) for the latest developments and to follow along.

## Getting Started

This repo contains the Verilog HDL code to create a VGA-, and later maybe HDMI-capable video driver using a compatible FPGA of your choice.  You'll need to have a development board with a suitable FPGA with at least 50 KB of internal RAM for later development versions and the software to read the project - in this case [Quartus II from Intel/Altera](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/downloads/download-center.html).  However, during early stages of development (for the text-mode design), you can get by on an Intel/Altera Cyclone II EP2C5T144C8 dev board, which can be had for less than Â£14 via everyone's favourite auction website - do a search for ['Cyclone II minimum development board'](https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=m570.l1313&_nkw=cyclone+II+minimum+development&_sacat=0).

### Prerequisites

* A suitable FPGA development board - detailed above
* The Quartus II project code in this repo
* An IDE for the FPGA to compile and upload the code (Quartus II)

## Built With

* [Quartus II](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/downloads/download-center.html) - The FPGA IDE used to create, compile and upload the code to the FPGA
