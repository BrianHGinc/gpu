# Microcom GPU

The aim of this project is to create from scratch a GPU or 'graphics card' for my home-made Microcom computer (details of which will be available on a website sometime in the future!)  This repo is a storage site for the HDL code used to describe the GPU itself and software tools that helped in its development.

When completed, the GPU will support text (via a VT100 compatible console) and graphics modes.  The project is currently in development - see [eevBlog](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/fpga/fpga-vga-controller-for-8-bit-computer/new/#new) for the latest developments and to follow along.

## Getting Started

This repo contains the Verilog HDL code to create a VGA-, and later maybe HDMI-capable video driver using a compatible FPGA of your choice.  You'll need to have a development board with a suitable FPGA with at least 50 KB of internal RAM for later development versions and the software to read the project - in this case [Quartus II from Intel/Altera](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/downloads/download-center.html).

During early stages of development (for the text-mode design) however, you can get by on an Intel/Altera Cyclone II EP2C5T144C8 dev board, which can be had for less than Â£14 via everyone's favourite auction website - do a search for ['Cyclone II minimum development board'](https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=m570.l1313&_nkw=cyclone+II+minimum+development&_sacat=0).

### Folders

This repository contains a number of folders and not all are essential to get a GPU up and running, although the non-essential folders will no-doubt assist in getting it set up and facilitate testing and tweaking.

Primary folders are:

#### GPU_256char_font
The main Quartus Prime project folder.

#### docs
Contains manuals, documentation and information on the project and its constituent parts.

#### fonts
Contains font files for use with the GPU.

#### test
Contains various Quartus II projects (yes, Quartus II - version 9.1) used for simulating and testing components of the project.

#### tools
Contains the RS232 debugger, written by Brian Guralnick, which is an essential part of the setup and testing for the GPU.

### Prerequisites

* A suitable FPGA development board - detailed above
* The project code in this repo
* An FPGA-compatible IDE for the FPGA to compile and upload the code (Quartus Prime)
* Note: *If you're using a Cyclone II, Quartus II/Prime does not support this FPGA after version 13.0sp2*

## Built With

* [Quartus Prime](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/downloads/download-center.html)
