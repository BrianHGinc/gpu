# Microcom GPU

## Tools folder

This folder contains two sub-folders:

* GPU_talk
* RS232_debugger

GPU_talk is written by Brian Guralnick, originally to be a tool used specifically in the testing of the Microcom GPU during development.  However, it has grown into a very capable and standalone project in itself, becoming the [RS232_debugger](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/fpga/verilog-rs232-uart-and-rs232-debugger-source-code-and-educational-tutorial/msg2801388/#msg2801388).

GPU_talk is here purely for historical reasons - use RS232_debugger for any testing and playing with the GPU.
